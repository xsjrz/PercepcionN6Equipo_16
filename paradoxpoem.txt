Paradoxes

This poem is full of paradoxes,
And the first one, like this goes,
Here are the rules,
Ignore all of the rules.

All life or all death does not exist,
if you want peace prepare for war.
Let's be realistic, demand the impossible.
The end is just beginning

I'm not superstitious because bad luck.
I only know that I know nothing
It's unlucky to be superstitious
Thank God I'm an atheist ...
