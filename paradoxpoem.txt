Paradoxes

This poem is full of paradoxes,
And the first one, like this goes,
Here are the rules,
Ignore all of the rules.


Imagine inside a box, a cat and a poison-dispenser gadget,
This device will and will not remain quiet,
But while the box lid closed remains,
The cat is death and alive, the theory sustains.

All life or all death does not exist,
if you want peace prepare for war.
Let's be realistic, demand the impossible.
The end is just beginning...

The end.
